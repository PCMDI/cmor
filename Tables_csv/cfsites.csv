"The sampling interval should be the integer multiple of the model time-step that is nearest to 30 minutes and divides into 60 minutes with no remainder. e.g. (30->30,20->20,15->30,10->30).   Outputs should be instantaneous (not time mean) and from nearest gridbox (no spatial interpolation.) Note that except for the quantities appearing in the Amon spreadsheet (first line of table below), all other fields are 3-D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
